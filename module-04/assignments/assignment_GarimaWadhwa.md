# Assignment 4


1. ![Displaying Catalog in the required format](../assignments/assignment-4.png)

XSLT is basically used or developed with respect to XML, to have a stylesheet for the XML document and to decide what element data to be dislayed in the required form.
I have used XPATH to have conditions for the 'for-each' select statemets for accessing each catalog item repeatedly and displaying various size columns with a subtable.
Used xsl:value-of to display the value of a particular element.Used HTML tags of <table>,<tr> to present the data in a table format having columns and rows. For gender column used <xsl:choose> tag to apply conditions for Male and women.
